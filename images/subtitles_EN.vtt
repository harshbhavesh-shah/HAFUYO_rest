[TACOS AL PASTOR by Jose Ramon Castillo]
Today we're going to learn how to prepare them

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:03.200
in a very homemade but very delicious way

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.399
and even making the trompo (vertical spit)

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.533
so first we need the marinade

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.046
we'll have our blender

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:10.600
beforehand I soaked

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.433
ancho and guajillo chilli peppers

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:15.599
[Previously soaked ancho peppers - 3 pieces]
the sweet ones, not the spicy ones

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:17.332
[Previously soaked guajillo peppers - 4 pieces]
let's put our peppers here

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.833
let's put it like this, fold it in quarters

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:23.133
[Fold in quarters and remove the excess]
remove the excess here

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:24.832
[Skewer the meat]

00:00:24.832 --> 00:00:26.430
between each layer

00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:29.948
[Add sliced onion between layers of meat]
we're going to add sliced ​​white onion

00:00:29.948 --> 00:00:32.705
[Repeat until the top is formed]
continue like this up to the top

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:35.498
at the end we're going to add the pineapple

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.419
okay?

00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:40.471
it's really delicious, let's put it in the oven

00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:41.599
[Bake at 230 °C for 30 minutes]

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:43.500
help it along with a sharp knife

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.524
and we're going to start cutting it

00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:46.280
very diagonally

00:00:46.677 --> 00:00:48.080
[Form tacos with the meat]
I like it with everything

00:00:48.713 --> 00:00:49.600
let's put it here

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.200
now, the whole little salad

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.412
pineapple

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:53.466
[To taste: onion, cilantro, pineapple, chopped]
personally

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.433
the salsa I like the most

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:57.300
for tacos al pastor

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.596
[Serve with salsa and lime]
it's the avocado one
